Array
----------------
1. Given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. 
There are no duplicates in list. One of the integers is missing in the list. 
Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.

2. Efficient Program to find smallest and second smallest element in an array.

3.Majority Element
Majority Element: A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element).

Write a function which takes an array and emits the majority element (if it exists).

4.Find the Number Occurring Odd Number of Times
Given an array of positive integers. All numbers occur even number of times except one number which occurs odd number of times. Find the number in O(n) time & constant space.


5.Count minimum steps to get the given desired array
Consider an array with n elements and value of all the elements is zero. We can perform following operations on the array.

Incremental operations:Choose 1 element from the array and increment its value by 1.
Doubling operation: Double the values of all the elements of array.
We are given desired array target[] containing n elements. Compute and return the smallest possible number of the operations needed to change the array from all zeros to desired array.
